TIP_HEADER,你知道吗...
TIP_1,每个单位每回合只能攻击一次
TIP_2,"每种单位有弱点和优点 - 只有步兵才能占领建筑物，但几乎没有对抗坦克的胜算，而坦克则无法攻击直升机。"
TIP_3,你可以在总部里部署士兵，但是在营房里这样做更便宜。
TIP_4,当一个单位夺取一个塔时，它失去了本回合的所有剩余行动点数
TIP_5,"所有生产建筑都需要一个士兵来维护它 - 占领它们将花费你一个士兵单位"
TIP_6,总部和占领的塔或机场每回合会产生现金
TIP_7,现金可以用于部署单位和移动
TIP_8,"明智地使用你的现金 - 一个庞大的军队将比一个小分队更慢、更低效"
TIP_9,单独派遣一个单位上战场永远不是一个好主意
TIP_10,在班组中混合单元的类型会给你带来战略优势
TIP_11,"阻塞出兵口将不能部署单位，敌人也不能 - 用你的单位封锁敌人的工厂"
TIP_12,"单位只能攻击相邻的格子 - 所以当你的目标很远时，你应该先让你的单位靠近"
TIP_13,"总部是游戏中最有价值的建筑物 - 如果你占领了敌方总部，你将赢得游戏"

MISSION_TITLE_MAYDAY_SQUARE,五一广场
MISSION_DESR_MAYDAY_SQUARE,经过数日的抗议，我们已经说够了。腐败和虐待必须停止！五一广场的抗议者已经准备好战斗了！接管自由战士的指挥权，攻占总统府。
MISSION_1_OFFICER_INTRO,"长官！ 我们准备对总统宫殿的发动袭击！ 部队正在等待您的命令。"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_OBJECTIVE,"This is the enemy HQ. We need to bring our soldiers there and capture it. Without central command, military forces guarding the Palace will disperse."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_1,"We should also claim as many communication towers as possible to gain more resources for our operations. Those are crucial, as we need to pay for the deployment of new units, and movement of those already in the field."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_2,"Our enemy is already capturing nearby towers, we need to hurry and take them back to gain advantage!"
MISSION_1_SOLDIER_SHOUT,"You are outnumbered! Stand down and let us get that corrupted bastard!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_ORDER,"Fall back soldier!"
MISSION_1_GUARD,"Rebel scum!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_COMMAND,"Sir! Our forces are on the edge, we need you to take command!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_NEARBY,"Palace defence HQ is close. Let's take it!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEFEND,"Sir! Enemy forces are getting dangerously close to our HQ! We should drive them back, otherwise we risk loosing this battle!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEPLOY,"Our forces have taken significant losses. We should deploy more soldiers from our HQ."
MISSION_TITLE_EASTERN_CITY,"Eastern city"
MISSION_DESR_EASTERN_CITY,尽管“五一广场”的事件使政府相对和平地更替了，但仍存在许多紧张局势。我们收到了一份报告，称有一群忠于前总统的激进分子。在他们的行动引发内战之前，找到并捕获他们的行动中心。
MISSION_2_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir, recently we've been getting reports of increased militia activity in this region. We suspect there might be an organized command centre nearby. We should investigate."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS,"Our forces are limited here. We should secure these infantry barracks. This building will enable us to deploy new soldiers for a lower price."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_TIPOFF,"Sir! We just got a tip off from local civilians indicating the location of the militia HQ. This is our objective."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_1,"Great work, Sir."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_2,"Please be advised, that claiming buildings other than communication towers will require our soldier to stay inside, so make sure we always have enough infantry on the battlefield."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_3,"There were some recruits waiting in the barracks. They have joined us."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_1,部署与移动单位将花费我们的资源。要明智地使用这些资源。
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_2,为了部署新的单位，建筑物旁边的专用出兵口必须未被占用。如果您的单位占据了该地块，您必须先移走它。
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_3,您也可以利用这个优势。阻挡敌方建筑旁边的出兵口，阻止他们部署增援部队。
MISSION_2_OFFICER_ALARM,"They have found us! Raise the alarm!"
MISSION_TITLE_RIOTS,Riots
MISSION_DESR_RIOTS,"The current government came to power by attacking our dear leader! And they dare to call us the rebels! New authorities are still weak. We should use this opportunity to take over key administration offices. Our forces are standing by and awaiting your orders!"
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Commander. Apologies for the delays."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"We finally managed to set up a camp. Wasn't easy to gather troops after we lost control of the army."
MISSION_3_OBJECTIVE,"Our objective is to take the City Hall. Local defense forces are still disorganized. We should use this window of opportunity."
MISSION_3_TANK_1,"Our militiants managed to steal a tank from nearby military base. It won't be long before someone notices."
MISSION_3_TANK_2,"Tanks are great at dealing with infantry - this one will be a valuble asset in this mission. Still, we need more if we are to succeed."
MISSION_3_TANK_FACTORY,"There is a tank fabrication facility nearby. Take it before the enemy uses those heavy units to stop our assault."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_1,"Great work, Commander. Nothing will stop us now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_2,"Local defense forces ordered a tank recently. I guess it is ours now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_AI,"Commander, this is not good! Local forces have taken active control of this factory. We need to re-take it, or we will face a lot more tanks that we can handle."
MISSION_TITLE_BASE_ASSAULT,"Base Assault"
MISSION_DESR_BASE_ASSAULT,"Our recent victory gave us a foothold, but we can not stop there. A nearby military base has a lot of equipment we could use! We have to attack before they realise that they are no longer in control of this region."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Great work on securing a foothold Commander, but our work here is not yet done."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"If we are to secure our presence in this region, we have to take over the military base."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"Armoured units are available. Expect the enemy base to deploy tanks of their own!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_1,"We've managed to cut off their landline communications, Commander. We should be able to overwhelm them before they can even call for help."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_2,"Still, we should not waste any time. They can still use comm towers."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_1,"This is perimeter base! We are under attack! Repeat, we are under attack!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_2,"This is not good, they managed to restore communications. We have to prepare for reinforcements."
MISSION_4_RAPID_RESPONSE,"Rapid response unit reporting in!"
MISSION_4_FORWARD_BARRACK,"Capturing these forward barracks would allow us to bring soldiers to the front line more easily."
MISSION_4_GUARD_WARN,"Rebels are getting close!"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_1,"With both towers near their HQ we knocked out their comms completely."
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_2,"What the... ? Command, come in. Anyone?"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_3,"Good luck with that."
MISSION_TITLE_PENINSULA,Peninsula
MISSION_DESR_PENINSULA,"Days of fighting are finnally paying off. Now we have the support of our strong neighbouring country. We are ready to push the usurpers out of the peninsula. When we succeed, there will be no way for them to re-take it. This will be our greatest victory!"
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Government forces throughout the peninsula are busy fighting local militia."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"With a cooridnated push, we can take control of this land before they can re-organize."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"This base safeguards a strategic route connecting the peninsula with the rest of the country. Taking control of this facility will cut off all remaining army, forcing them to surrender."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_1,"This is an airforce outpost meant to support the main base. Defences seem to be minimal, they did not expect an attack from this direction."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_2,"We should claim this building for additional air support."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_1,"There is more equipment here, than we expected. They probably regret loosing this outpost already."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_2,"Attack helicopter reporting for duty."
MISSION_5_FLANK,"With the right flank secured, we were able to bring in some reinforcements."
MISSION_5_BLOCK_1,"You will not get away with this, traitors!"
MISSION_5_BLOCK_2,"It is you, who betrayed our great President! Arrest him!"
MISSION_TITLE_RECAPTURE,Recapture
MISSION_DESR_RECAPTURE,"The situation is deteriorating quickly. We have to start pushing back, or we will lose all of our progress in this conflict. We are ready to liberate the city, where the rebels began their operations. Let us show them, and the people, that simple bandits are no match for our military."
MISSION_6_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Sir. As you may already know, recent setbacks have put us in an unfavourable position. We have to start pushing back."
MISSION_6_INTRO_2,"Our intel suggests, that this city is where it all started. Rebel activity appears to have lessened since the initial attack - they probably moved on."
MISSION_6_INTRO_3,"Still, we should not underestimate the garrison stationed here. Liberating this city will be an important step in our campaign."
MISSION_6_INTRO_4,"Sir, the base of operations is up and running."
MISSION_6_INTRO_5,Good.
MISSION_6_INTRO_6,"Air support reporting in."
MISSION_6_INTRO_7,"We've got decent amount of ground units, though our air capabilities are limited for this engagement. Use these assets well."
MISSION_6_APP_BASE,"Sir, this looks like an abandoned rebel encampment. It seems they had no way of moving all this equipment, so they just left it."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_1,"There are two comm towers on the left flank."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_2,"There may be some AA emplacements in the area, but if we capture those towers, we will be able to guide in more air support safely."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_3,"Anti-tank team has arrived."
MISSION_6_PATROL_1,"Patrol squad reporting back."
MISSION_6_PATROL_2,"No rest for you, we are under attack!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_1,"We are loosing ground! Warn the Commander!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_2,"Yes Sir!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_3,"He got away. Doesn't matter, let's focus on the mission at hand."
MISSION_TITLE_BASE_DEFENCE,"Base Defence"
MISSION_DESR_BASE_DEFENCE,"Alert! Rebels are attacking one of our military bases in the eastern region! We can't allow them to capture any more of our assets. Defend the base and destroy the rebel forces in the region!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_1,"Alarm! Unidentified troops spotted near the base perimeter!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_2,"They spotted us! Commence the attack!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_3,"Sir! We had reports of enemy movements in the area, but we did not expect them to organize so fast."
MISSION_7_INTRO_4,"And they are taking the auxilary barracks! Tank factory is probably being attacked as well. We have to protect our flanks."
MISSION_7_LEFT_CLAIMED,"Left flank secure."
MISSION_7_RIGHT_CLAIMED,"Right flank secure."
MISSION_7_TRAP,"We've got you now!"
MISSION_7_BASE_1,"You might think you are winning, but this is only a minor setback. We will be back, and in greater numbers!"
MISSION_7_BASE_2,"We will see about that."
MISSION_7_TOWERS_1,"We've managed to take over enemy communication line and intercept some chatter about plans on attacking an airport."
MISSION_7_TOWERS_2,"This cannot be good..."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_1,"Airport Pt.1"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_1,"Fighting between our militia and the government forces is not going as well as we had hoped. We need to show the world we are not giving up just yet. The nearby airport is not of huge strategic importance, but capturing it will be our manifestation of power!"
MISSION_8_INTRO_1,"Forward camp is ready, Commander."
MISSION_8_INTRO_2,"Commander, let's get going."
MISSION_8_INTRO_3,"This is the local airport. It is not of high strategic importance, but loosing it will strike fear into enemies hearts."
MISSION_8_FACTORIES,"Reiconessanse reports multiple tank factories in the area. Those helicopters will come really handy."
MISSION_8_APP_AIRPORT,"Target spotted."
MISSION_8_CAP_AIRPORT_1,"Objective achieved."
MISSION_8_CAP_AIRPORT_2,"Now let's clear this area of enemy units, we can't risk loosing this terminal."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_1,"Let's clear those tanks."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_2,"Commander, while searching the airport we have found some documents left by the enemy officers."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_3,"It is some kind of flight schedule, probably for military supplies. We will make good use of this."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPLANE,Airplane
MISSION_DESR_AIRPLANE,"Thanks to the airport equipment, we have intercepted communications about an important military aircraft flying over the area. We have identified the perfect spot to launch missiles from, but it is guarded by the enemy. Muster your forces and get into position to shoot down the transport!"
MISSION_9_INTRO_1,"If the information we aquired is correct, there should be a military plane flying over this area soon."
MISSION_9_INTRO_2,"We have identified best position to set up our AA emplacement, but it is currently occupied by the enemy."
MISSION_9_INTRO_3,"Our camp is still being developed. We have to capture facilities available throughout the city to bolster our forces."
MISSION_9_TURN2_1,"Long range radar that we captured on the peninsula just reported it is tracking a vessel coming from the west."
MISSION_9_TURN2_2,"We still have plenty of time, but we have to finish our mission before the window of opportunity closes."
MISSION_9_TURN10_1,"The tracked vessel is closing in, we should hurry."
MISSION_9_TURN10_2,"We are also tracking a group of attack helicopters. They might be heading your way."
MISSION_9_TURN15_1,"The transport will be passing over any minute. We can still catch it."
MISSION_9_TURN15_2,"Eagle Squad ready for patrol duty... What is this? The base is under siege! Attack formation!"
MISSION_9_TURN18_1,"That airplane is already past our position. We have to prepare the attack now."
MISSION_9_TURN20_1,"The target is out of reach. We have failed, Commander."
MISSION_9_APP_HQ,"Closing in on the designated area. AA guns ready for deployment."
MISSION_TITLE_FIELD_COMMAND,"Field Command"
MISSION_DESR_FIELD_COMMAND,"These separatists just shot down a civilian airplane, hundreds of people died! Their violence has to stop! Our scouts have found the enemy field command center for this region. Our resources are limited, but we should be able to gather more men and tanks in the nearby city."
MISSION_10_INTRO_1,"Those fanatics just destroyed a civilian plane full of people! With ground-to-air missiles! Where did they even got this kind of equipment?"
MISSION_10_INTRO_2,"We have to stop this madness before more people suffer."
MISSION_10_INTRO_3,"Recon, do you have anything for us?"
MISSION_10_INTRO_4,"Local command center located, Sir. Attempting infiltration..."
MISSION_10_INTRO_5,"Not so fast!"
MISSION_10_INTRO_6,"We have been spotted! I repeat..."
MISSION_10_INTRO_7,"Now they know we're here. Looks like we have to assault this base old-fashioned way."
MISSION_10_TOWER_1,"Comms established. Requesting backup."
MISSION_10_TOWER_2,"Somebody called?"
MISSION_10_HQ_1,"Closing in on enemy position. They are surrounded by mountains, nowhere to go!"
MISSION_10_HQ_2,"Enemy reinforcements detected!"
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_2,"Airport Pt.2"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_2,"The rebel forces have scattered after losing their local HQ. The airport is still heavily guarded, but they will not receive any new reinforcements anytime soon. Our Recon-Team managed to set up a small base.  We need to attack before they can pick themselves up!"
MISSION_11_INTRO_1,"Welcome back, Sir.  We have finally got a green light on re-taking that airport."
MISSION_11_INTRO_2,"This area is highly contested. Luckily, our recent victories forced our foe to re-group, so they can't expect help anytime soon."
MISSION_11_RECON_1,"This is recon. We have located enemy HQ. Looks like they are fortifying their position."
MISSION_11_RECON_2,"Moving out before they spot us."
MISSION_11_CAP_TOWER,"Sir, the forest road is blocked. It looks like we could clear it out if we brought a tank here."
MISSION_11_TANK,"Load main gun! Fire!"
MISSION_TITLE_CONVOY,Convoy
MISSION_DESR_CONVOY,"In this time of war many people are suffering. Our kind neighbour offered to send us a humanitarian convoy with food, water and medicine. The government does not believe in our good intentions, and won't allow the trucks to pass. We have to clear the way!"
MISSION_12_INTRO_1,"The transports will be ready to go very soon."
MISSION_12_INTRO_2,"Nearby city really needs what's in these trucks. We have to secure the road."
MISSION_12_INTRO_3,"Capturing and holding these towers along the way should allow us to go safely."
MISSION_12_CROSSROAD_1,"This mountain pass is vital to our operation. We have to hold this position."
MISSION_12_CROSSROAD_2,"The enemy base is going to put a pressure on us from the flank. Take it out if you can, but do not compromise our mission, Commander."
MISSION_12_TOWERS_1,"Congratulations on securing the route. Now we should be able to co-ordinate our forces and defend the convoy."
MISSION_12_TOWERS_2,"They will not stop us."
MISSION_TITLE_CRASH_SITE,"Crash Site"
MISSION_DESR_CRASH_SITE,"The plane we attacked went down deep within the forest. We must not allow anyone to reach the crash site. Without the wreckage, no one will be able to prove by whom and how it was destroyed. International investigators are on their way, we have to stop them."
MISSION_13_INTRO_1,"Commander, I assume you already heard about our little... mistake."
MISSION_13_INTRO_2,"As it turns out, that military transport we shot down wasn't a military vessel at all."
MISSION_13_INTRO_3,"We have managed to blockade the crash site for now, but international investigators are on their way."
MISSION_13_INTRO_4,"Secure this position, Commander."
MISSION_13_TURN3_1,"Armoured column, move forward."
MISSION_13_TURN3_2,"Get out of our way, and we might just let you withdraw your forces... for now."
MISSION_13_TURN3_3,"Save your breath."
MISSION_13_HALF_WAY,"Sir, we have scouted an airfield near the enemy HQ. We have to be cautious when pushing with tanks."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_3,"Airport Pt.3"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_3,"It has been months since we started fighting over this wretched airport. It is hardly an airport anymore either, with everything reduced to rubble - the terminal, the tower, the surrounding city. Even so, it is still a symbol of who has the upper hand here, and it should be ours!"
MISSION_14_INTRO_1,"My apologies, Commander. We lost the airport you previously secured. Enemy attack was switft and devastating."
MISSION_14_INTRO_2,"We don't have much footing here. Taking control of the barracks building on the other side of the forest is a good start."
MISSION_14_INTRO_3,"I've dispatched a couple of small squads to scout out the battlefield ahead."
MISSION_14_TURN2_1,"We have some initial reports."
MISSION_14_TURN2_2,"The old encampment is ruined, though some light weapons for infantry can be salvaged for training more troops."
MISSION_14_TURN2_3,"Tank factory has been abandoned when it lost power, but we should be able to restore basic functions."
MISSION_14_TURN3_1,"Most of the city is completely ruined."
MISSION_14_TURN3_2,"Airport buildings have been blown up, not much left in there. Military hangars seem fairly untouched, we should be able to use them."
MISSION_14_TURN4_1,"We have visual confirmation on one of the enemy encampments. Looks like their command centre is not here."
MISSION_14_TURN4_2,"I think they spotted us, falling back."
MISSION_14_TURN4_3,"It's a trap!"
MISSION_14_TRAP_1,"Commander, we have found explosive traps in most of the buildings. They really didn't want us to capture it."
MISSION_14_TRAP_2,"And it seems, that explosions alerted them. Expect increased resistance."
